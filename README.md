# Folium

Folium is a Latin word as Portfolio. Folium is my side project focusing mainly on my web app development skills. Folium is also a showcase where I am proud to display all of my expertise and hobbies relating to engineering.
Folium is developed using NextJS Framework and TailwindCSS for front-end styling.

# The current deploy is considered stable but Folium is still in development and has many issues. Feel free to give feedback!
